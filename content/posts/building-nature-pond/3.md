## Depth and Shelves
A nature pond doesn't have to be especially deep, you can dig a pond out as shallow as 30cms deep and nature will use it. However, I think there is a good reason to dig it deeper than that either in the middle or at one end. The deeper it is, the more water there is when we  have pro-longed hot spells the pond will still have water for those animals and plants that need it. 

A nature pond benefits from shelves which act as steps down to the deeper part of the pond.  The following illustration show a top down view of pond shelves:

Shelves are great for situating plants that live in the shallows of a pond, situating rocks and pebbles to protect and disguise the liner. And also help avoid steep banks that can make it difficult for nature to escape.  So if you can factor in digging them, so much the better for the pond.

## Breaking Ground
Once you have measured out and are ready to dig then it is time to start.

This is simple enough - with your spade or edging tool, push down and break the soil along the outside edge of the area you are excavating. If you are working in an area of grass or turf then you need to scalp this layer of grass and roots off first.

## Dig out a few inches across the whole area.  
Dig out the whole area to a approx 4 inches deep, this will be the depth of your first pond shelf and it will be the shallowest part of the pond. 

Once you have cleared the area to the depth, start digging out the next lower shelf.  This is done by loosely marking out a hole at least 6 or so inches from the outer perimeter.
