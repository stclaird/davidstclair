## Depth and Shelves
A nature pond doesn't have to be especially deep, you cag dig a pond out as shallow as 30cms deep and nature will use it. However, I think there are reasons to dig it deeper than that either in the middle or at one end. Those r

A nature pond benefits from shelves which act as steps down to the deeper part of the pond.

## Breaking Ground
Once you have measured out or are at least ready to dig then it is time to start.

This is simple enough - with your spade or edging tool, push down and break the soil along the outside edge of the area you are excavating. If you are working in an area of grass or turf then you need to scalp this layer of grass and roots off first.

## Dig out a few inches across the whole area.  
Dig out the whole area to a approx 4 inches deep, this will be the depth of your first pond shelf and it will be the shallowest part of the pond. 

Once you have cleared the area to the depth, start digging out the next lower shelf.  This is done by loosely marking out a hole at least 6 or so inches from the outer perimeter.
