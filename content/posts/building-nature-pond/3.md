## Depth and Shelves
A nature pond doesn't have to be especially deep, you can dig a pond out as shallow as 30cm deep and nature will use it. However, I think there is a good reason to dig it deeper than 30cm either in the middle or at one end. Basically, the deeper it is, the more water there is and when we have pro-longed hot spells the pond will still have water for those animals and plants that need it. Also during the winter months frogs seem to hide at the bottom to escape the colder spells.

A nature pond benefits from shelves which act as steps down to the deeper part of the pond.  The following illustration show a top down view of pond shelves:

Shelves are great for situating plants that live in the shallows of a pond.  The are also great for situating rocks and pebbles to protect and disguise the liner and underlay. And also help avoid steep banks that can make it difficult for wildlife, especially the less agile types such as hedgehogs, to escape.  So if you can factor in digging them, so much the better for the pond.

## Breaking Ground
Once you have measured out and are ready to dig then it is time to start.

This is simple enough - with your spade or edging tool, push down and break the soil along the outside edge of the area you are excavating. If you are working in an area of grass or turf then you need to scalp this layer of grass and roots off first.

## Dig out a few inches across the whole area.  
Dig out the whole area to a approx 4 inches deep, this will be the depth of your first pond shelf and it will be the shallowest part of the pond. 

## Dig out a shelf or two
Generally a shelf is better dug out reasonably level, not spirit-level level but level enough to put plants and pond shelf rocks without them falling into the bottom of the pond.
Once you have cleared the area to the depth of about 4 inches or so, start digging out the next lower shelf.  This is done by loosely marking out a hole at least 6 or so inches from the outer perimeter, then digging another 4 inch drop.  Once this second shelf is completed you are ready to dig out the deepest part of the pond "The deeper zone".
