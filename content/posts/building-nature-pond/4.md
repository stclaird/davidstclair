## Installing the Underlay
Unfold or unroll your underlay and drop it into the pond, push it into the corners and shelves as neatly as you can flattening out and large creases.  If you are using thick carpet it maybe a little more challenging than other materials to get flat and in the corners.  If it is too difficult then a sharp knife, can be used to split and overlap any bulges.

If you are using sand as the underlay then this is a different process altogether than laying down a underlay sheet or large squares of carpet.  Instead of laying the materials, you will be layering on the sand like icing a cake. This is really only possible if the sand is damp, as it needs to be sticky enough to hold in place.  Builders yellow sand is ideal for this as it generally comes quite moist compared to something like, kiln dried sand which is too fine and powdery for this task.

## Install the liner
Once the underlay is down, you can move onto the actual liner itself. Worth noting, the liner needs to be treated with more care than the underlay as it may become damaged by sharp objects, for example any tools you have in the area.

Stretch the liner across the width of the pond, push it down into the deep parts of the pond
