## Installing the Underlay
Unfold or unroll your underlay and drop it into the pond, push it into the corners and shelves as neatly as you can flattening out and large creases.  If you are using thick carpet it maybe  little more challenging than other materials to get in the corners.  If it is too difficult then a sharp knife can be used to split bulges which can then be overlapped to lower their profile. 

If you are using sand as the underlay then this is a different process altogether, it is more a case of layering on the sand like icing a cake. This is really only possible if the sand is damp, which is is often the cases with builders soft sand but not always with plastering sand and certainly not with kiln dried sand.
