## Installing the Underlay
Unfold or unroll your underlay and drop it into the pond, push it into the corners and shelves as neatly as you can flattening out and large creases.  If you are using thick carpet it maybe a little more challenging than other materials to get flat and in the corners.  If it is too difficult then a sharp knife, can be used to split and overlap any bulges.
