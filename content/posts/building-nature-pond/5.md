## Edging
The edge of a wildife pond is part of the pond that does need a bit of thinking, and it can be the part which is hard to look nice, at least straight away.

The edging serves the following purposes:

1. To hide the unsightly liner / overlay and give a more natural and attractive look.
2. To protect any exposed liner, although ideally there shouldn't be any liner exposed.

### Dry Stone Wall
If you have steps at the edge  in your pond and you have enough rocks and stones you can lay a mini dry stone wall starting as far below the water level as possible.  This gives a very attractive natural look especially when it starts to attract moss. A dry stone will continue to hide liner or underlay when the pond water level inevitably drops in hotter weather which can otherwise be exposed.

This not only looks great, but it also provides lots of hidy holes for creatures such as frogs and newts.
The downside is it does take quite a lot of rocks which can be expensive if you are buying them or time consuming if you are scavenging them.

### Planting up
The pond can be covered with earth and suitable pond pond edd
### Brick Wall
You can create a pond with a landscaped brick edging which looks very attractive but that requires planning efore you start digging out.  This it beyond the scope of this article , since I have never attempted this kind of edging before;

##  Lay the edge stones.
If you have carved steps into the top of the pond then, now you can loosely lay your pond edging rocks into the steps in the approximate positions.  You don't have to make this the entire finished article at this stage as this is just to give you an idea of how it is going to look and to prevent the liner flapping about or moving.
