## Getting Started
### Measuring out 
This guide is about building ponds with flexible liners. Although the flexible part of its name comes from the flex in its material  you can also be quite flexible about measuring out the shape and size your pond is going to be.  If you are planning a small oval shaped pond, then measuring out is so simple as to almost not be required. You can just start digging with your spade, being mindful of the size of liner you are planning to purchase or have purchased.  If you are creating a larger complex shape or perhaps a more rigid shape like a neat square shape then you need to measure out with some guides. 

What do I use for guides?  Well, if you are planning on digging a straight square or rectangle pond then 4 tent pegs or small 6 inch pieces of wood make good guides. One hammered in upright at each corner with a length of string connecting them to form a square or rectangle in the ground.  For example, if you wanted to make a 2 metre square shaped pond, then its just a case of hammering the pegs in 2 metres apart.

If you plan to do a more natural shape then a hose pipe or length of rope laid in the shape you choose, this will provide the guidance for digging. Alternatively, take a can of paint and paint out the shape you want.

## Preparation
Not much in the way of preparation is needed - however there are a couple of things to consider.

- Where will you put the excavated soil whilst you are digging. You need to put it sufficiently far enough away that it doesn't get in the way of digging and gives enough clearance for laying the liner. 
- The weather. Fairly obvious really but the weather has a bearing on your pond digging.  If it is mid-summer then the ground will be hard and there may be no rain water about to fill the pond with.  Neither are show stoppers but worth considering.  The same if it is very wet, the ground will be soggy and digging in this can be come like the Battle of the Somme. Well perhaps that is a overstating it a bit but you will get muddy!


## Breaking Ground
Once you have measured out or are at least ready to dig then it is time to start.

This is simple enough - with your spade or edging tool, push down and break the soil along the outside edge of the area you are excavating. If you are working in an area of grass or turf then you need to scalp this layer of grass and roots off first.

## Dig out a few inches across the whole area.  
Dig out the whole area to a approx 4 inches deep, this will be the depth of your first pond shelf and it will be the shallowest part of the pond. 

Once you have cleared the area to the depth, start digging out the next lower shelf.  This is done by loosely marking out a hole around 6 or so inches from the outer perimeter.
