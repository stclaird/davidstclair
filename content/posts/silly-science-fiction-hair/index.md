The aliens and civilisations in movies from the 1960s, 70s and 80s often sported a splendid space bob.  Before I compiled this blog post I couldn't tell you which films and TV programmes had them I knew they existed. 

## 1. UFO
 UFO is a British TV series created by Thunderbird's creator Gerry Anderson.  I have never watched this series but I did spot that the space ladies' hair is regulation purple Space bob.

## 2. Warlords of Atlantis
Warlords of Atlantis is a 1978 Doug McClure classic Sci-Fi adventure. Well sort of, it isn't actually set in Space or even set in the future, instead the film mostly takes place under the sea in Atlantis in the late 19th Century. However, the alien civilisation  originated from outer space.  How do I know they came from Space? Well one of the main aliens, Atmir, has a Space bob complete with pronounced widow's peak.  Also I think they tell you all about it in the story.

## 3. Buck Rogers Golden Man
Buck Rogers is a U.S Sci-Fi series with plenty of ridiculous aliens and costumes.  In one episode entitled the Golden Man, the golden boy and few others all have the Space bob. And very convincing they look too.

## 4. War of the Robots
War of the Robots.  Hmm, I haven't watched this film, and I don't know if I could. Maybe I am missing out, but I do know that some of the "Robots" have shiny Space bobs.
