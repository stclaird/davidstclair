      <description>Depth and Shelves A nature pond doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be especially deep, you cag dig a pond out as shallow as 30cms deep and nature will use it. However, I think there are reasons to dig it deeper than that either in the middle or at one end. Those r
A nature pond benefits from shelves which act as steps down to the deeper part of the pond.
Breaking Ground Once you have measured out or are at least ready to dig then it is time to start.</description>

      <description>Getting Started Measuring out This guide is about building ponds with flexible liners. Although the flexible part of its name comes from the flex in its material you can also be quite flexible about measuring out the shape and size your pond is going to be. If you are planning a small oval shaped pond, then measuring out is so simple as to almost not be required. You can just start digging with your spade, being mindful of the size of liner you are planning to purchase or have purchased.</description>

      <description>Mankind has all but won the war on nature. Species are in retreat all over the world and here in the UK the situation is no different.
However, although the outlook for nature looks a bit bleak, all is not lost and there is one direct and simple action that you can take to help call a truce with nature and that is to dig a pond in your garden.</description>

      <description>The aliens and civilisations in movies from the 1960s, 70s and 80s often sported a splendid space bob. Before I compiled this blog post I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put my finger on which films and TV programmes featured characters with space bobs but even so I kind of knew they existed.
The list 1. UFO UFO is a British TV series created by Thunderbird&amp;rsquo;s creator Gerry Anderson. I have never watched this series, although it gets a respectable score (7.</description>

      <title>Setting up an AWS EC2 Auto-scaler and performing a simple scaling up event.</title>

      <description>AWS auto-scalers, to me at least, are the service that standout as being one of the most “Elastic-y” in the Elastic offerings from AWS. They can be configured to automatically expand and shrink on demand. Which by most definitions is pretty elastic.
Auto-scalers can be configured to fire up more ec2 compute instances when demand on already running instance(s) reaches a user definable threshold. For example if you have a group of ec2 compute instances working on a queue of jobs and that queue is keeping all of the server&amp;rsquo;s processor tied up consistently for say, 10 minutes the auto-scaler will detect this and launch up another ec2 instance.</description>

      <description>If you have ever wanted to make a change to some of the settings to your php setup via PHP.ini file then using puppet and the augeas type could be the perfect solution. Augeas will read in a configuration file and allow you to specify changes and save them for you. Augeas is not actually a puppet specific tool and can be used generally for configuration file alteration. Of course, you could use an ERB template to build the php.</description>

      <description>If you find yourself with a lot of rackspace cloud volumes you need to remove, you can do this manually or you can run a simple python script.
This very simple example shows you how to delete snapshots taken of rackspace cloud volumes older than N days. In this example N days will be 7 days.
This example makes the following assumptions:
you have a Pyrax installed you have your Rackspace API credentials key.</description>

      <title>Snapshot Rackspace CBS volume with Python Pyrax</title>

      <description>This very simple example shows you how to take a snapshot of a Rackpace cloud volume. This document makes the following assumptions: -you have a Pyrax installed -you have your Rackspace API credentials key. -you know your Rackspace volume uid – which looks like this: 56568786-4659-67575-9ab3-6767968
Add the pyrax import import pyrax Prepare to initialize your pyrax by setting the identity type and add your rackspace api credentials pyrax.set_setting(&amp;#34;identity_type&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;rackspace&amp;#34;) pyrax.</description>

      <title>Automatically Backing Up Remote Servers with Qnap 109</title>

      <description>Introduction If you run an important server such as web server you should of course take regular off site backups. Now everyone knows that backups are a total pain to do manually and more often than not get forgotten. However, using linux cron you can automate this task easily and be more confident of your ability to recover should anything go wrong with your server and you need to restore. Depending on how much you have to backup and if you have a decent xDSL type connection speed at your home or office you can persuade a QNAP 109 NAS to take care of this for you.</description>
